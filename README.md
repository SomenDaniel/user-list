# **User List**

## Digital Natives - Developer Position - Second Assessment - Solution

[Heroku site](https://sd-user-list.herokuapp.com/)

- At some places i had to take a different approach like in the task.

### How it works:

- You need to refresh the site when you click the status change button.
- Sometimes after status change, the user can disappear to another page because its position changed in the users array.
- After user editing, or creation you need to go back to the homepage.

### Strange behaviors in the app:

- Sometimes when you click the status change button and refresh the site, nothing happening with the status.
- In that case, you need to click again and it works.
